## Overview
The **Orbital Mechanics Simulation Toolkit** provides a set of MATLAB and Python scripts for modeling and simulating space-based mechanics, including coordinate transformations, orbital element calculations, interplanetary trajectory solutions, and more. The toolkit is designed for educational and research purposes and is a resource for those interested in understanding or working within astrodynamics.

## Requirements
- **MATLAB** (R2021a or later recommended) OR **Python** 3.8+
- MATLAB’s `ode45` and other built-in functions
- Python packages (only if using Python versions of the scripts):
  - `NumPy`
  - `SciPy`
  - `Matplotlib`

## Features
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Convert between orbital elements and state vectors.
- **Orbit Simulations**: Simulate different types of orbits, including two-body and three-body systems.
- **Trajectory Calculation**: Calculate interplanetary and lunar trajectories.
- **Root Finding & Numerical Methods**: Implement bisection, Runge-Kutta, and Heun's methods for solving differential equations.
- **Orbital Elements & Ephemerides**: Compute positions of celestial bodies (e.g., Sun, Moon) for a given Julian date.
