Overview
--------

Space-Sciences-and-Astrodynamics is a comprehensive, open-source toolkit for modeling, simulating, and analyzing orbital mechanics and astrodynamics problems. It provides MATLAB, Python, and C++ implementations of core algorithms, numerical methods, and visualization tools, based on foundational principles and extending concepts from *Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students* by Howard D. Curtis.

Key Features
------------
- Conversion between orbital elements and Cartesian state vectors
- Simulation of spacecraft trajectories under gravitational and non-gravitational forces
- Calculation of interplanetary trajectories and orbital perturbations
- Numerical solutions to astrodynamics equations using advanced algorithms
- Visualization of orbits, ground tracks, and other dynamic phenomena

Getting Started
---------------
- For installation and build instructions, see the project README.
- For API usage, see the modules section below.
- For course and example scripts, see the course_scripts section.
